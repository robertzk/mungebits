\title{Translate a list of arguments passed to a mungebit into a mungepiece}
\usage{
parse_mungepiece(args, train_only = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{args}{a list. This can be of the formats
\code{list(train_fn, ...)}, \code{list(list(train_fn, predict_fn), ...)},
and \code{list(list(train_fn, ...), list(predict_fn, ...))}. In the first
example, the train and predict function are assumed to be identical. In
the first two examples, the arguments to these functions are assumed to
be identical (for example, if the same kind of filter needs to be applied
to a data set that is about to be trained as to one about to be
predicted). Finally, the last example is the most flexible and allows
different parameters for the training and prediction function,
respectively. The given training and prediction functions are used to
construct a \code{mungebit}, and the resulting \code{mungebit} and 
the remaining arguments are stored in a \code{mungepiece}.}

\item{train_only}{logical. Whether or not to leave the \code{trained}
parameter on each mungebit to \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} accordingly.
For example, if \code{stagerunner = TRUE} and we are planning to re-use
the stagerunner for prediction, it makes sense to leave the mungebits
untrained. (Note that this will prevent one from being able to run the
predict functions!)}

the parsed mungepiece
}
\description{
For example, one can pass a training function, a prediction function,
and additional arguments, and the constructed mungepiece will hold
these arguments, ready to call the attached mungebit on a given dataframe.
